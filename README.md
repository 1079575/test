# Image Enhancement Script

This script has been created to enhance images through a range of techniques including denoising, histogram equalization, bone enhancement, sigmoid correction, and contrast stretching. It operates by handling images sourced from a designated input directory and then stores the improved versions in an output directory

## Requirements

•	Python 3.x

•	Libraries:

       • NumPy
       • scikit-image (skimage)
       • OpenCV (cv2)
       • PIL (Python Imaging Library)
       • TensorFlow (for the CNN model)
#### For NumPy:

`pip install numpy`

#### For scikit-image (skimage):

`pip install scikit-image`

#### For PIL (Python Imaging Library):

`pip install opencv-python-headless`

#### For TensorFlow (for the CNN model):   

`pip install tensorflow`







## Usage

Place Input Images:

   • Put your input images in the specified input  directory.

Configure Directories:

   • Update the input_directory and output_directory   variables in the script to match your directory paths.

## Run the Script

```python image_enhancement.py```
